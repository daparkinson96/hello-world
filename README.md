# hello-world

Hello World! As you can see, this is my first repository! 

I am a computer science major who enjoys programming using Java, C++, and much more. I am hopeful to graduate from college in the Fall of 2020. I also have a passion for video games, but I mostly play the Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto and Madden NFL series. I am also an avid fan of the New Orleans Saints. Who Dat!
